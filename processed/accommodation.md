Accommodation:
The conference organizers do not arrange accommodation for participants. Each participant must book their accommodation
individually at one of the many downtown hotels in Rennes. The city has numerous bus lines and two metro lines, with
easy access to Beaulieu campus. It takes 10 minutes to reach the campus by the new metro line (B) and up to 20-25
minutes by bus. Suggested itineraries to reach Beaulieu campus from the city center are detailed on the Venue page.
Participants may book a hotel in the southern or northern city center, as both areas are well connected by public
transportation. A list of accommodation options is available on the Tourist Office Site of Rennes.
