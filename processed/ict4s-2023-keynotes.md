ICT4S 2023 Conference Keynotes
---

The ICT4S 2023 Conference will feature three keynote speakers who will discuss various aspects of sustainability and its
intersection with ICT. The conference aims to provide a platform for researchers and industry practitioners to present
and discuss their latest research on sustainable ICT, share knowledge, and identify new research directions and
collaboration opportunities.

# June 6th - Hugues Ferreboeuf

Hugues Ferreboeuf, from The Shift Project, will deliver a keynote speech on the need to shift away from Big Tech
business models to make digitalization sustainable. He argues that the rapid growth of digital "volumes" and the
resulting increase in the digital environmental footprint is due to the business models of the dominant players of the
digital economy. The shift towards sustainable digitalization requires the implementation of appropriate public policies
that will reduce the attractiveness of current Big Tech business models and promote and support the development of a new
digital economy.

# June 7th - Anne-Kathrin Peters

Anne-Kathrin Peters, an associate Professor in technology education at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, will
deliver a keynote speech on the complexities and possibilities of ICT education for sustainability. She will present
research on how university education reproduces unsustainable norms, values and power structures, focusing on the field
of computing and engineering education. She will also discuss ongoing efforts to transform computing and engineering
education for sustainability and argue that education needs to be reimagined and developed with recognition of its
complexity, various roles and purposes.

# June 8th - Jean Jouzel

Jean Jouzel, former vice-chair of the Scientific Working Group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
will deliver a keynote speech on global warming and the need for a new model of development and the key role of higher
education. He will examine the causes and consequences of ongoing global warming in the light of recent IPCC reports,
and argue for the absolute need to keep global warming well below 2°C, and much better around 1.5°C, to enable young
generations to adapt to future climate change. He will also argue that research, innovation and creativity are essential
for going towards a low carbon society, and that this "ecological transition" requires large dedicated teaching efforts
in higher education and throughout our lives.
