Sustainability
==============

[Foreword](#foreword)
---------------------

As with most human activities, a scientific conference will have some negative impact on the environment, regardless of
how it is organized. The “most sustainable” way to organize a conference is therefore to not have a conference at all −
even though in this scenario we obviously lose all the social benefits that a conference brings.

Since we did decide to organize a conference, what remains is a matter of making choices, by considering the tradeoff of
each decision, hoping that the social benefits of our choices will outweigh the environmental costs. We also have to
remain humble and honest, as the range of action to improve the sustainability of an in-person conference is limited,
given that air travel represents by far the biggest cause of environmental impact.

This page aims to explain what actions we endorsed to make ICT4S 2023 more sustainable, and what actions we considered
and did not endorse. In the appendices, we also present what data and studies we used to make our decisions.

[Actions endorsed for ICT4S 2023](#actions-endorsed-for-ict4s-2023)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the studies presented at the end of this page, we selected a set of target actions to make ICT4S 2023 more
sustainable. We also considered a few additional actions that we believe can be beneficial, despite being not directly
considered in said studies.

### [Going online? (hybrid or fully virtual)](#going-online-hybrid-or-fully-virtual)

By far, most of the negative impact of a conference comes from air travel. An additional small negative impact also
comes from hotel stays, which are not environmentally friendly. Due to the pandemic, we are now more technically and
mentally prepared to meet and discuss online instead of in-person. This opens the possibility to cut between 40% and 80%
of the carbon footprint of the conference by deciding to organize a hybrid conference (mixing both online participants
and participants coming to a venue) or a fully virtual conference (all participants online with no venue) respectively.

Yet, even though it cannot be easily measured, we believe that the cost of going online outweighs the environmental
benefits that this format would bring. Here we quote the authors of the main study we considered for our decision making
\[1\]:

> “ Further measures of environmental optimization could be identified, e.g. digital meetings. It is however unlikely
> that those will totally replace physical meetings. **The social benefits of direct personal and globally-oriented
exchange can probably not be outweighed by environmental savings.** Future conference planning should thus relate the
> sustainability benefits with the detrimental impacts. ”

For this reason, **ICT4S 2023 will not be an online conference**. Instead, we provide online access only for exceptional
situations, and we will strongly encourage train travel to reach the venue. We hope that making the community meet
in-person will contribute to bringing exciting and outstanding research results, in order to help on a grander scale to
drive our digitalized society into a more sustainable future.

### [Vegetarian and/or plant-based meals?](#vegetarian-andor-plant-based-meals)

The second most negative impact of a scientific conference is the food and catering. Most impactful are animal-based
products (meat, fish, dairy, etc.), which for manifold reasons require much more energy and land use than plant-based
products. One possibility to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of a conference would therefore be to only
provide vegetarian and/or plant-based meals.

Yet, food is not only a required input for human bodies. It is also a very important cultural aspect of our lives and
history. ICT4S 2023 will be organized in France, a country with a strong relationship with food, and with a cooking
style that relies heavily on animal-based products. In this context, going fully vegetarian would not only force
caterers to perform an incredible (and possibly disappointing) sidestep, but also prevent participants from discovering
what is part of the country’s heritage.

For these reasons, **ICT4S will not be a strictly vegetarian conference**. Instead, we aim to have vegetarian choices of
the highest quality, and to reduce the amount of animal products used overall in all meals.

, you can find a few restaurants in Rennes that are specialized in plant-based cuisine — currently
only [Symbiozh](https://symbiozh.fr/), [Les Enfants Terribles](https://www.facebook.com/enfantsterribles.cafe/)
and [Petite Nature](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/PetiteNatureRennes/), all mostly serving during lunch hours but
unfortunately not in the evenings. More typical French restaurants rarely offer a wide range of vegetarian choices, but
it is possible to find more vegetarian-friendly cuisine in Lebanese, Tibetan, or Indian
restaurants. [Happycow](https://www.happycow.net/searchmap?s=3&location=Rennes%2C+France) is also a good source for
vegetarian-friendly restaurants.

### [Environmental impacts of conferences](#environmental-impacts-of-conferences)

There is a rising academic interest (eg. \[1-7\]) on measuring the environmental impacts of science or of conferences.
To drive our decisions for ICT4S 2023, we focused on a study from 2020 \[1\] that provides what appears to be the first
complete life-cycle analysis (LCA) of a scientific conference. More precisely, the authors measured the holistic
environmental impact (carbon footprint, natural resources consumed, acidification, eutrophication, etc.) of a complete
conference series in the field of sustainability research. The study also includes some “what-if” scenarios to help
identify possible efficient levers to reduce the footprint of a conference.

We made the assumption that the results from this study \[1\] can be transposed to a conference such as ICT4S. Here are
some important takeaways that we took into consideration:

### [Environmental impacts of transportation](#environmental-impacts-of-transportation)

As explained above, because of the sheer amount of kilometers that must be covered by each attendee to reach the
conference venue, transport is usually the biggest environmental footprint of a conference. To better understand why
this is the case, we can look at the main available options:

Of course the possibilities depend significantly on the distance to be travelled, on the means of transport available,
and on time or organizational constraints— in the end, air travel is often the only possibility!

### [Environmental impacts of food](#environmental-impacts-of-food)

As explained above, the second largest portion of a conference’s environmental footprint usually lies in the food eaten
by its participants. Here are two important facts that made us aim for local and vegetarian options during the
conference:

### [Environmental impacts of beverage packaging](#environmental-impacts-of-beverage-packaging)

In some rare cases we might not be able to eliminate waste caused by beverage packaging during conference events.
Looking at a recent Life-Cycle Assesment (LCA) focusing on beverage packaging \[13\], we learned the following:
