Call for Sponsors
=================

**Become a Sponsor of ICT4S 2023, and expose your organization, company, product or service to hundreds of people
interested in ICT and Sustainability (e.g., green IT, ICT for sustainability, etc.).**

The following describes available ICT4S 2023 sponsorship opportunities. The international conference series ICT4S (The
International Conference on Information and Communications Technology for Sustainability) brings together leading
researchers in ICT for Sustainability with government, industry representatives, artists, students and the general
public. In 2023, we expect to have 150 researchers in the Research Program, but also a broad representation of the
government, industry, arts and education in a comprehensive OFF! Program offering a large set of satellite events (
panel, debate, art performances, keynotes, hackathon). Therefore, as a sponsor of ICT4Sâ€™23, your organization will have
a unique opportunity to gain visibility as well as to interact with the various communities involved.

To become a sponsor or simply ask any question about our sponsorship opportunities please send an email to the general
co-chair Benoit Combemale (benoit.combemale@irisa.fr). In your request, please indicate a) the sponsorship level you are
interested in (see below) and b) an overview of what you wish to promote at the conference (e.g., tool, service,
organization membership, book etc.). All prices listed below are in Euros; please be aware of exchange rate
fluctuations.
