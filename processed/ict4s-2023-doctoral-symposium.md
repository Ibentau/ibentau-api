ICT4S 2023 Doctoral Symposium:

The Doctoral Symposium is a one-day event that will be held on Monday, June 5, 2023, in connection with the ICT4S 2023
conference. The symposium welcomes any doctoral student who has already settled on a dissertation topic and whose
doctoral research will benefit from external feedback. The symposium is run in a highly interactive and collegial format
designed to help students move their work forward.

The program is tentative and subject to change. The symposium will have four sessions, with coffee breaks and lunch
breaks provided. The lunch will be at Le Diapason. The accepted papers will be optionally published in an open access
archive (CEUR).

Submissions for the Doctoral Symposium should be submitted via EasyChair, and submissions are due on March 17, 2023.
Notification of acceptance will be given on April 7, 2023. Camera-ready papers are due on April 28, 2023. An abstract
submission is recommended by March 10, 2023.

Thanks to the generous support of the University of Rennes 1, conference grant applications covering the registration
fees are invited to help authors of accepted DS 2023 papers attend the conference. To apply for the grant, please send
an email once accepted to the doctoral symposium.

The Doctoral Symposium Committee will use the following criteria to curate the participants for the symposium. The
accepted papers will be published in an open access archive (CEUR) if desired.
