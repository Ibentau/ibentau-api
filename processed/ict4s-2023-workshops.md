WorkshopsICT4S 2023
===================

The workshops at ICT4S 2023 look to facilitate the exchange of new ideas and directions in all areas related to
sustainability and digital technology. A variety of formats are welcome and will be considered, ranging from traditional
research paper presentations to interactive and participatory sessions. Given the urgency of the climate crisis we
invite proposals that cover controversial viewpoints, national and global public policy interventions, emerging
technology drivers or transformative ideas aimed at changing basic assumptions. The workshops will be held on Monday
June 5, 2023, and Friday June 9, 2023.

Call for Workshops
------------------

At ICT4S 2023 we are facilitating two kinds of workshop:

1) [Formal Workshops](https://conf.researchr.org/track/ict4s-2023/ict4s-2023-workshops#formal-workshops) - workshops
   looking to establish annual gatherings and publish proceedings associated with topics covered by ICT4S. We expect to
   publish a proceedings volume including all accepted workshop papers in an open access archive (
   e.g., [arXiv’s Computing Research Repository](https://arxiv.org/help/submit_index), [CEUR](http://ceur-ws.org/)).
   These workshops are expected to include a full peer review process for workshop submissions (facilitated by the
   workshop organisers).

2) [Community Workshops](https://conf.researchr.org/track/ict4s-2023/ict4s-2023-workshops#community-workshops) -
   workshops for community building and passionate discussion in emerging topics relating to ICT4S. These workshops may
   also draw in a wider audience and we welcome proposals from community, business and local government that might help
   start a dialogue to develop solutions.

We invite workshop proposals of traditional or unconventional formats for evening, half-day, or full-day workshops.
Workshops are to be held on Monday, June 5, and Friday, June 9, 2023. Other slots during the main conference period may
also be available.

### [**Formal Workshops**](#formal-workshops)

Formal workshop proposals should be between 4-6 pages long and include:

### [Further details](#further-details)

All workshops can be provided with the following resources: catering (coffee breaks and lunch), conference materials,
WIFI, white board with markers, projector/screen, laptop (upon request), and a room. Formal workshop organisers are
expected to set up and manage their own submission and review processes. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that
workshop organizers set up websites and social media accounts to help publicize the event.

### Accepted Workshops

### [](#designing-the-sound-of-sustainability-community-workshop)[Designing the Sound of Sustainability](https://soundforenergy.net/ict4s_workshop.html) - Community workshop

This workshop will explore the use of sound as a tool to explore sustainability data – what is the sound of home
electricity use? Flight emissions? Energy mix? By converting otherwise abstract or impenetrable data into audio using
sonification techniques, can we open up new methods of experiencing sustainability issues, and perhaps narrow the
knowledge- action gap? We will introduce different techniques for using sound in this way, and invite participants to
create their own sonifications. Finally, participants will develop frameworks for applying advanced sonifications to
their own research, and these will be taken forward to an audio-focused workshop in the near future to be put into
practice. We envisage this workshop to be an opportunity for participants to learn about what sound can bring to
sustainability discussions, as well as be a part of a longer term project applying sustainability research data to sound
in novel ways. The concepts that we develop together will inform the running of another workshop for researchers in
audio soon after ICT4S, and a third session is planned to bring together any participants who wish to follow the work
long term.

### [](#radical-rapid-prototyping-for-ict4s-community-workshop)[Radical Rapid Prototyping for ICT4S](http://disnovation.org/ict4s.php) \- Community workshop

Artwork has the ability to bring people from diverse backgrounds together to encounter, discuss and address the pressing
challenges of our ages. At this year’s ICT4S, the art collective disnovation.org is very present, as featured in
Wednesday evening’s program and with a continuous presence in the lobby with a poster action through the whole
conference. This workshop will be an opportunity to work closer with the artists, exploring methods for generating
innovative transdisciplinary approaches to complex issues such as climate change and energy transition. Participants can
bring their own pet ideas, current preoccupations and open questions, especially ones provoked by presentations at ICT4S
2023. Together, we will synthesize key problems and then break into groups to sketch out creative approaches to
addressing these problems. The workshop goal is on one hand to represent, through art practice, sustainability issues,
and challenges and on the other hand to understand challenges in new ways through collaborating artistically. Outputs
will include sketches, mind-maps and other aesthetic approaches to the issues that we will work on together, as well as
the experience of working speculatively in new ways, towards future transdisciplinary collaboration and the development
of the participants’ pedagogical and communication methods.

### [](#sustainability-trade-offs-in-ai-barriers-and-enablers-to-more-sustaianble-ai-community-workshop)[Sustainability trade-offs in AI – Barriers and enablers to more “sustaianble AI”](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/paris-de/ict4s-2023-community-workshop/) - Community workshop

The development and use of “Artificial Intelligence” systems has diverse impacts on social and environmental
sustainability. While social issues such as the fairness of AI systems have been the focus of much public debate, the
direct and indirect adverse environmental impacts (resource and energy use; increases in consumption induced by AI) have
received less attention. To address multiple sustainability challenges in software and AI systems several sustainability
frameworks have been developed. However, these frameworks seem to be known and applied by only a minority of software
practitioners. With this workshop we explore several reasons why this might be the case by discussing with the
participants:

Main objectives of workshop: connect actors, revisit existing sustainability frameworks, discuss challenges and
opportunities related to their practical implementation, identify next steps for collaboration Number of participants:
15-20

### [Assessing the indirect effects of ICT – a review of some existing methodologies and frameworks and way forward - Community workshop](#assessing-the-indirect-effects-of-ict-a-review-of-some-existing-methodologies-and-frameworks-and-way-forward-community-workshop)

#### [Background:](#background)

The interest for the indirect effects of ICT – in particular their positive effects whether referred to as enabling
effects, abatements, avoided emissions or second and higher order effects – has perhaps never been more widespread. The
methodological basis for these claims, however, is often underdeveloped or problematic, and indirect negative effects
are often ignored.

#### [Content:](#content)

We thus invite researchers, practitioners and policy makers to a day where we get up to date with the methodologies and
frameworks that have been published since last ICT4S conference (by actors such as the International Telecommunication
Union, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the European Green Digital Coalition and the Mission
Innovation Framework), review their content to provide feedback based on our collective experience and engage in
discussions on specific methodological considerations.

We will also reserve a slot for ideation regarding what could be done to optimize ICT towards positive impacts while
suppressing any negative impacts.

We hope this will be an opportunity to further advance the understanding of this complex topic and provide guidance for
way forward.

#### [Inputs:](#inputs)

Participants are welcome to contribute analyses or proposals related to specific methodological aspects as input for the
discussions. Such inputs could either be based on theoretical and conceptual analysis of challenges and solutions, on
practical experiences from applying these or similar methodologies or refer to associated policy challenges. Any input
will be evaluated with respect to relevance, but no formal peer review will be performed. Contributors may be asked to
present at the workshop.

### [](#towards-a-sustainable-energy-aware-information-and-communication-technology-formal-workshop)[Towards a sustainable energy-aware Information and Communication Technology](https://www.lms.tf.fau.de/sevic/) - Formal workshop

Significant changes in social behavior and consumer demand has triggered exponential growth in video consumption, with
video now accounting for more than 82% of online data traffic. This rapid growth will continue in the coming years
requiring massive energy to support the production, the delivery and the end-user consumption. This is not at all
sustainable with respect to the amount of energy required and the ecological emergency we have to face.

Given the complexity of the challenges, all actors, going from the video production to the final video consumption by
the end-users, have to promote, support and develop initiatives that would contribute to the energy consumption
reduction. This full-day workshop will not only present the magnitude of the energy consumption problem but will also
elaborate on key initiatives for reducing the energy consumption.

The objectives of the proposed workshop are (i) to raise industrial and public awareness for a sustainable information
and communication technology (ICT), (ii) to monitor and evaluate the energy consumption all along the video chain, (iii)
to introduce new energy-aware technologies, (iv) to present standardization activities. For each objective, at least one
presentation will be planned. Presentations should last between 30 and 40 minutes. We expect people from academia,
industry, and local governments. The one-page long abstracts and presentation slides will be published on the website of
the workshop.

Since sustainability is not yet a mainstream subject within computing education, this workshop aims to provide a forum
for cross-domain interaction by bringing together members of ICT4S community to share perspectives and present findings
relevant to research and practice in education. In addition, the workshop aims to provide a platform for participants to
collaboratively work on expanding the body of knowledge in sustainability education and to jump-start new collaborations
through the live creation of teams that commit to working together on concrete topics. A significant portion of the
workshop is devoted to focused interaction among the participants with the goal of generating a research agenda to
improve processes and practices, tools, techniques, and methods regarding the sustainability education in computing. The
Workshop Objectives are:

We are open to the submission of contributions by March 13th and will publish within the joint CEUR ICT4S workshop
proceedings. Check our website [https://ict4sedu.wordpress.com](https://ict4sedu.wordpress.com) and reach out to us with
questions.

### [](#green-software-and-human-actors-design-code-and-behavior-community-workshop)[Green Software and Human Actors: design, code, and behavior](https://gsha2023.sciencesconf.org/) - Community workshop

Achieving the ambitious goals for sustainability requires collaboration between different research disciplines and
domains, as the impact of technological-only optimizations slows down. In this community workshop, we aim to build
bridges between green software and green IT, UX/UI design, and behavioral studies. The workshop will bring communities
together to share ideas and design, build and sustain the next generation of sustainable computing, involving human
actors (such as end users, developers, and deciders).

This full-day workshop aims at building community. We expect people from academia, industry, and local governments. Two
30-minute presentations from academics will take place in the morning on software energy efficiency, and on HCI and
climate change, followed by a 60-minute keynote. After 2-minute self-introductions from all the participants, selected
and voluntary 10-minute presentations will take place during 1 hour. Then, discussion will take place in the afternoon
about required skills to answer major research questions: (1) how to guide user interface designers for energy-efficient
interaction? (2) how to assist end users for energy-efficient interaction? And (3) how to provide data to end users for
energy-efficient digital behavior?

Proposals for 10-minute presentations will be submitted on EasyChair. An abstract up to 500 words will depict speakers’
presentation. Abstracts and presentation slides will be published on the website of the workshop.
