============================

The international ICT4S conferences bring together leading researchers in ICT for Sustainability with government and
industry representatives, including decision-makers with an interest in using ICT for sustainability, as well as artists
and researchers focusing on ICT effects on sustainability and developers of sustainable ICT systems or applications. In
order to smoothly run the conference and associated workshops and tutorials, we need student volunteers to help out on
the practical aspect of the organization. All the events associated with ICT4S 2023 will take place from Monday June 5,
2023, to Friday June 9, 2023 in Rennes, France.

### How to apply?

Student Volunteers play a key role in the success of ICT4S by helping the conference from registration to local matters.

practitioners from all over the world that share your interest in ICT for Sustainability! Such interactions often help
shape the research direction for many students. The student volunteer opportunity is available to undergraduate,
graduate, and doctoral students from all over the world who are enthusiastic and willing to contribute to make ICT4S
2023 a unique experience for all attendees. Would you like to be part of the ICT4S 2023 organization? Donâ€™t miss your
