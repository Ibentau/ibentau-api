The OFF! Program
================

The OFF! Program complements the research program of ICT4S 2023 with a set of satellite events bringing together
researchers, practitioners, decision and policy makers, artists, students and the general public. It features various
kinds of events on campus as well as in pubs downtown. In particular, the OFF! Program includes general keynotes,
panels, debates, art performances, etc.

The overall program will be available soon on this webpage. Currently, we are glad to announce the confirmation for the
following events:

#### Sustainable digitalization: Why we need to shift away from Big Tech business models

A **keynote** by Hugues Ferreboeuf from [The Shift Project](https://theshiftproject.org/en/home/). Since 2017, Hugues
Ferreboeuf steers the ‚ÄúLean ICT‚Äù project for the Shift, at the crossroads between digital and energy transitions.

### Sustainable digitalization: Why we need to shift away from Big Tech business models

The unsustainable growth of the digital environmental footprint over the last decade is due to the rapid growth of
digital ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù, which have outpaced efficiency gains. This growth is a result of the business models of the dominant
players of the digital economy, namely the largest digital platforms (GAFAM, BATX) and their derivatives (Netflix,
TikTok etc.). To make digitalization sustainable, a transition away from these digital superpowers is necessary, and
alternative, sustainable business models must be adopted. The initiation and acceleration of this transition requires
the implementation of appropriate public policies that will reduce the attractiveness of current Big Tech business
models and promote and support the development of a new digital economy.

### Biography

Polytechnician, Engineer from the Corps des Mines and a graduate of T√©l√©com ParisTech, Hugues Ferreboeuf has held
several senior management positions in subsidiaries and business units within the France Telecom Orange Group. He then
led an international double career in management, as an entrepreneur and consultant. He has been at the head of the
Banking and Finance sector of the British Telecom Group, where he was involved in numerous digital transition projects.
He then got specialized in the management of transitions (energy, digital, generational) and, since 2017, he steers the
‚ÄúLean ICT‚Äù project for the Shift since 2017, at the crossroads between digital and energy transitions.

#### A quiz run by The [CNRS GDS EcoInfo group](https://ecoinfo.cnrs.fr/)

The CNRS EcoInfo group will propose a quiz on the environmental impacts of ICT. This quiz is guaranteed to have no
winners, no prizes and no question about the carbon footprint of an email. Come and have a go!

#### [Disnovation.org](http://disnovation.org/index.php) collective art performance

The performance will consist of screening a selection of short 3D films about the issues of energy, innovation, and
sustainability; each one introduced in connection to specific ICT4S issues by the artist‚Äôs collective, and followed by a
moderated debate. The Disnovation artist‚Äôs collective will also perform over the week several live interviews, and will
interact with ICT4S participants through take-away posters and questionnaires.

### Disnovation.org collective art performance

#### POST GROWTH PROTOTYPES / Performative Lecture

This lecture/performance is an invitation to a collective and practical examination of our shared future, examining the
notion of growth,in its many facets and implications, testing the limits of technology, of politics, and of
ourimaginations.

With their series of new artworks, the [DISNOVATION.ORG](https: //disnovation.org) collective invites us to challenge
concepts of growth and progress and explore the radical implications of speculative artistic prototypes, such as an
economic model based on the energy emitted by the Sun. This research encounters the vital challenges of a shift away
from the overexploitation of fossil fuels on which the reproduction of our societies mainly depends today.

How long can we continue pursuing economic growth? What ideological, social, and biophysical factors precipitate the
current environmental crises? What agency is available for transformative practices and imaginaries to avert large-scale
ecosystemic breakdown?

#### Biography

[DISNOVATION.ORG](https: //disnovation.org) is a research collective set up in Paris in 2012, whose core members include
Maria Roszkowska (PL/FR), Nicolas Maigret (FR), and Baruch Gottlieb (CA). They work at the interface between
contemporary art, research, and hacking, and compose tailor-made teams for each investigation together with academics,
activists, engineers, and designers. More specifically their recent artistic provocations seek to empower Post Growth
imaginaries and practices by challenging the widespread faith that ‚Äòeconomic growth‚Äô and ‚Äòtechnological fixes‚Äô will
solve the ecosystemic disruptions they produced in the first place. They recently co-edited A Bestiary of the
Anthropocene with Nicolas Nova, an atlas of anthropic hybrid creatures, and The Pirate Book, an anthology on media
piracy.

#### Global Warming: The need for a new model of development and the key role of higher education

A **keynote** by [Jean Jouzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jouzel), former vice-chair of the Scientific Working
Group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

### Global Warming: The need for a new model of development and the key role of higher education

If nothing was done to manage the increase of the greenhouse effect tied to human activity, we should see, at the end of
this century, a minimum average 4 ¬∞C increase in temperature worldwide which will increase well beyond 2100. The impacts
of such a ¬´ business as usual ¬ª scenario would be difficult if not impossible to handle. And these difficulties will
hold true for a +3 ¬∞C climate change a level which could be reached in the current context of the Paris agreement. After
briefly examining the causes and consequences of this ongoing global warming in the light of recent IPCC reports, we
will conclude on the absolute need to keep global warming well below 2¬∞C, and much better around 1.5¬∞C, if we want today
young generations be able to adapt to future climate change in the second part of this century and beyond. We will argue
that research, innovation and creativity are essential for going towards this low carbon society but that this ¬´
ecological transition ¬ª also requires large dedicated teaching efforts in higher education and all along our life.

### Biography

Prof. Jean Jouzel is a prominent French glaciologist and climatologist and a former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change. He has mainly worked on the reconstruction of past climate derived from the study of the
Antarctic and Greenland ice. He is internationally recognised for his research on climate change, and has received
numerous scientific awards, including the CNRS Gold Medal (the highest scientific award in France) and the Vetlesen
Prize (considered to be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for the Earth Sciences). He is also a member of the French,
Italian, European, American and Australian Academies of Science.

#### [Jan van Esch](https://janvanesch.com/) art performance : MITUMBA invasive species II an interactive performance by Jan van Esch

Jan van Esch is an Amsterdam-based multi-media artist whose practice spans performance, drawing, curation, and social
engagement.

### Jan van Esch art performance

#### MITUMBA invasive species II an interactive performance by Jan van Esch

Feeding on the culture of excess Jan delves into otherwise ignored psychological motives and power play between giver
and receiver - questioning the concept of western giving by highlighting a lack of dialogue, the cosmic disconnect
between the donation boxes in the West and the second hand (mitumba) markets in the South. He intentionally weaves
clothes, movement (or lack thereof), to create a body of work that sets to provide an alternative relationship between
giver and receiver ‚Äì introducing an ideal cyclical dynamic of being both giver and receiver in exchanging motion.

#### Biography

Jan van Esch is an Amsterdam-based multi-media artist whose practice spans performance, drawing,curation, and social
engagement.

Drawing on his background in social and health sciences and international development aid, Jan‚Äôs work questions
processes of ‚Äògiving‚Äô by delving into the subliminal psychological motives involved in the powerplay between giver and
receiver.

Exploring specifically how the Western world deals with waste, especially (re)used clothing, Jan's most recent work uses
performance, installation, and drawing to subvert traditional conceptions of the gift.
